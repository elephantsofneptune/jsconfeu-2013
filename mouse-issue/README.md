===========
![Spotify Logo](../resources/spotify-logo.png)

Cross-browser issue regarding handling mouse events.

**Points: 1**

The QA engineer of your team has reported an issue in the drag and drop feature you developed; 
although the original author says that the code works on his machine. 
As you know that the developer who did this code tests in IE and Chrome, you decide to investigate what is happening.

* Identify the problem in the mouse library and the browser where it happens.
* Propose a valid patch for fixing it.
* **Hint 1:** Regarding IE, you only support IE9+; where you know the original author tested it.
* **Hint 2:** After passing the unit tests, you know that the method "_pointInRect" is fully tested and working.
